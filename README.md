# CPfold
Brownian dynamics simulation of colloidal particle folding in Matlab/c++. 
Code for simulating Brownian dynamics of a worm in 2 and 3 dimensions.
optSA intends to optimize the rate of assembly into a target configuration.
tpt performs transition path theory on a worm initial condition to study folding pathways.
