Data are characterized into several folder.
states simply contains an empty database of all states and example coordinates from a BD run.
purge contains the same empty database of all states, with non-rigid states removed. 
mfpt contains results of mean first passage time estimator runs. Morse, Lennard-Jones, or MCMC. 
lump contains the mfpt data combined over all states which are permutations of eachother. 
strat contains the frequency results from a stratification sampler run. 
design contains the particle identities when doing multi-particle type design problems.
